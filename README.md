# TiledMaps

![Layer one](img/layerone.png)

This is Redmond, a tranquil area where giant tech firms like Microsoft and Nintendo rest. As you can see from the amount of green shades present in the downtown area, it's not urbanized and remains rural for the most part. This map has zoom level 10-16. In the first tile, I used the "Outdoors" style from Mapbox. I chose this style for it highlights the rural vs urban areas in the city. For the second thematic layer, I placed two pins on places where I visit the most often: one is Target where I get daily supplies, the other is Uncles Games where I can buy board games.
